# Professional README Generator

## Description

This project was created with the intent to assist those that would like to quickly create a README file for their projects. This is a README.md generator command-line application. A problem that this application can solve is that it allows the developer to dedicate more time in their project instead of spending more on creating their README file.

## Installation

Before using the application, you would need to install npm in the command line of the terminal from the application repository. You can install it by running the command: npm install.

## Usage

In order to utilize this application the developer would need to download the app to their computer and open it in their Visual Studio Code or their own source code editor. You would have to open up a terminal within the directory. Once you do an npm install on the command line, you would have to follow by entering: [node index.js]. With that command, the application will function. You will get a series of questions and can answer them by typing an input. The answers will be transfered to a new file containing the generated README.md file. A video demonstrating how the application works will be attached shortly.
